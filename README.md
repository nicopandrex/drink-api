# drink-api
Simple API I created for learning REST APIs, Get, Add, Update, and Delete drinks from a Database

Intstall requirements from requirements.txt

Uses Flask and python, you can simply host this and then you will be able to send requests to add drinks, get drink data, delete a drink, or edit a drink

Very simple nothing special
